1.Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.
Ans:-
Data types are the classification of data into different categories based on the type of value it can hold.
Primitive Data types are the basic data types that are built-in and can be used directly in a program which is immutable and used to store a single value
Non-Primitive Data types are the data types that are derived from the primitive data types and can be muttable and store multiple values
Example of Primitive Data types are number,string,bool,undefined,etc
console.log(10);
let str1="double quotes";
console.log(str1,typeof(str1));
let str2='single quotes';
console.log(str1,typeof(str2));
let str3=`backticks quotes`;
console.log(str1,typeof(str3));
let bool1=true;
console.log(bool1,typeof(bool1));
let bool2=false;
console.log(bool1,typeof(bool2));
let num1=10;
console.log(num1,typeof(num1))
let num2=10.2345;
console.log(num1,typeof(num2))
let num3=10e3;
console.log(num1,typeof(num3))
let a;
console.log(a,typeof(a));
let x=null;
console.log(x,typeof(x));
